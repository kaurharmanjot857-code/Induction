# Day - 2 
## 9:30 am - 10:30 am
At starting , we had an english proficiency test which was quite interesting and brain triggering .It included grammar ,reading and writing based questions . 

## 10:30 am - 11:30 am
Then we had the maths proficiency test which comprised of questions based on differentiation , linear equations in 2 variables , finding median , other aptitude based questions. 


In between we marked the attendance that I attempted the tests.

After that we had lunch break from `11:30 am to 1:00 pm` 

## Satya scholarship program
In the Satya Scholarship Program lecture, we learned about a scholarship initiative that provides full academic fee support to eligible students.The name of the organisation was buddy4study which has multiple scholarship schemes going on .The organisation scheme is to donate the money through scholarship to the students of various colleges in ludhiana . The discussion focused on the eligibility criteria and how the program aims to support students financially to pursue their education without monetary burdens.Also they told us that till 2025 they have donated about 60 crores of money to needy students.Then they also made us go through the regitration process which included family details and the individual's details about class 12th marks etc .For registration , two of the documents are required that are the student bonafide and the fees structure for the specific branch or course.Moreover, we were told not to ride on two different boats means we should not fill two scholarships ,its wrong, only one is enough for an individual.Also for the scholarship amount to be transferred,the students need their own bank account which is really important . If not possible due to any reason , a substitute account can be used which must be of either of the parents (father or mother). Students were told that the documents and the photos which they will upload should be really clear , not blurred . The discussion ended with telling us that if students don't want to avail the scholarship instead if they want to donate money ,then they can also do so.

## Food - a pivotal role in student's overall wellness
This lecture was given by Dr Arshdeep singh who is currently working in Punjab agricultural university as a food specialist.

In the lecture , the speakers introduced to us that the food we eat everyday has a very deep effect on our overall body working and mental health. Food is really important which should include a balanced diet containing good carbs ,proteins and fats.

Also he told us that we should not rely on the fast food and the processed food to fill our appetite instead it should be the minor part of out diet and the major part of our diet should include healthy homemade food. He further told us that we can take `jaggery`, `lassi`, `curd`and `yogurt` in our diet which will be really helpful. Several common myths were addressed, such as the belief that milk should not be consumed with meals as it leads to a skin disease which is totally wrong and illogical to say or that drinking tea with cold foods is harmful .

We were also advised against consuming cold drinks due to their high sugar content , we were told that the soft drinks contain upto 70 percent of just sugar . As a healthier alternative, it was suggested to drink Maaza mixed with soda water to reduce sugar intake while still enjoying a refreshing and fizzy beverage as soda only contains carbon dioxide . 

Moreover , he cleared our minds that the fruit drinks that we consume don't contain the real pure fruit juice but an alternative derived chemical that is the food concentrate etc .Further we were awared about the white sugar and the brown sugar ,the difference is just that white sugar is processed . Furthermore we were told about the white bread , brown bread and whole wheat grain bread , their differences also. 

It ended up by the fact that we should really note that what we eat and investigate that is it good for our health ? (mental + physical) .


## Github repo creation and markdown syntax

We were given a tutorial about the github (signing up )and how to create a repository specifically a readme file . Further we were told about the markdown language and its basic syntax . It was really interesting to know such a new place to write the data and whole day experiences. The whole lecture was given by senior Harsimran singh in the college auditorium .

### Then mam Harpreet kaur grewal (HOD - Applied sciences) did some announcements about regularly attending classes , changing sections and downloading bonafide and fee structure from the college website .

## Reflection
Overall , in a nutshell , the starting of the day was a bit thinking based with the tests but they are also equally important to know that where we actually stand . The lecture on satya scholarship made me realise the financial need and its importance in the field of education.Same goes with the lecture on the importance of food which made me learn a lot about the vitality of food towards the mental health especially .After learning the new platform github and the repositories , I really felt that I am learning something new and more towards our subject (coding) .The day was a rich blend of practical learning, future planning, and skill-building. It left me feeling more prepared — not just academically, but also for the broader challenges and opportunities ahead.

##  Morning Session

### 1. **Mathematics Lecture (8:30 AM - 9:30 AM)**

Although this session was titled under Mathematics, it was conducted by a senior student who introduced us to **Canva**, a graphic design tool. Instead of math, we explored creativity by designing a **flyer** on the topic **"Athletic Meet"**.  

- The session included:
  - A basic tutorial on how to use Canva.
  - Step-by-step flyer creation guided by the senior.
  - Each student designed their own flyer using the tools demonstrated.
  
This session was an excellent opportunity to integrate design and creativity into our daily learning.

### 2. **Basics of Electrical and Electronics Engineering (BEEE) - Lecture 1 (9:30 AM - 10:30 AM)**

**Instructor:** *Mr. Balwinder Singh*  
This session focused on introducing fundamental electrical laws, specifically:

- **Kirchhoff’s Laws:**
  - **Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL):** The total current entering a junction is equal to the total current leaving it.
  - **Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL):** The sum of all voltages around a closed loop equals zero.

- **Sign Conventions:**
  - Explained the rules for identifying EMF rise and fall.
  - Discussed voltage across a resistor and how to apply the sign convention.

- We also practiced one **numerical problem** based on these laws, helping us understand practical applications.

### 3. **English Lecture (10:30 AM - 11:30 AM)**

**Instructor:** *Ms. Puneet Narang*  
The English session focused not on grammar or literature, but on **communication skills**, emphasizing that English in college is a **practical skill-based subject**.

Key topics discussed:

- **Nature of Communication:**
  - English is not just a subject but a tool for personality development.
  - It plays a vital role in expressing thoughts, ideas, and building confidence.

- **Role of Language:**
  - Used for thinking, speaking, writing, and expressing.
  - Language is a core part of effective communication.

- **Important Concepts:**
  - **Kinesics:** Body language.
  - **Paralanguage:** Tone, pitch, and volume in speech.

- **Factors Affecting Communication:**
  - Psychological well-being
  - Self-confidence
  - Clarity of thought

This session was inspiring and made us understand the real-life importance of communication beyond academic theory.

### 4. **Chemistry Lecture (11:30 AM - 12:30 PM)**

**Instructor:** *Ms. Mandeep*  
We began with the **Water Chemistry** chapter.

Topics covered:

- **Sources of Water:**
  - Rainwater is considered the purest form.
  - Other sources include groundwater, rivers, and lakes.

- **Hardness of Water:**
  - Hard water contains salts of calcium (Ca²⁺) and magnesium (Mg²⁺).
  - It does not form lather with soap due to chemical reactions forming precipitates.

- **Types of Hardness:**
  - **Temporary Hardness:** Caused by bicarbonates (removed by boiling).
  - **Permanent Hardness:** Caused by sulfates and chlorides (not removed by boiling).

- **Key Reactions:**
  - Explained the reason behind the absence of lather with soap using chemical reactions.

- **Relative Strength of Salts:**
  - Calcium sulfate is the strongest, and calcium carbonate is the weakest.

- **Units of Water Hardness:**
  - **ppm** (parts per million)
  - **mg/L** (milligrams per liter)
  - Both units are equivalent in water hardness measurement.

## Afternoon Session

### 5. **BEEE Lab Session (1:30 PM - 2:30 PM)**

In the lab session of BEEE:

- We continued exploring **Kirchhoff’s Laws**.
- Solved a practical **loop-based numerical** involving voltage sources and resistors.
- Applied sign conventions and analytical techniques to determine current flow.

This hands-on problem-solving session helped reinforce the concepts learned earlier in the theory class.

### 6. **E-Cell Charcha 12 (2:30 PM onwards)**

Instead of attending the last lecture, I participated in an interactive session called **Charcha 12** organized by the **E-Cell GNDEC** in **Room F101**.

Highlights of the session:

- Discussion by senior students on:
  - **Low bandwidth product development**
  - Importance of creating **"Made in India"** products.
  - Challenges in India’s tech industry due to lack of infrastructure.
  - Why Indian consumers often buy foreign products (e.g., affordability, better design).

- **Activity:**
  - We were asked to **design a logo** on the theme **"Made in India"** using **Canva**.
  - Submission was done through a provided link, which also marked our attendance.

This session was both eye-opening and creatively stimulating, pushing us to think about innovation, entrepreneurship, and national pride.
