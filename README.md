## Satya scholarship program
In the Satya Scholarship Program lecture, we learned about a scholarship initiative that provides full academic fee support to eligible students.The name of the organisation was buddy4study which has multiple scholarship schemes going on .The organisation scheme is to donate the money through scholarship to the students of various colleges in ludhiana . The discussion focused on the eligibility criteria and how the program aims to support students financially to pursue their education without monetary burdens.Also they told us that till 2025 they have donated about 60 crores of money to needy students.Then they also made us go through the regitration process which included family details and the individual's details about class 12th marks etc .For registration , two of the documents are required that are the student bonafide and the fees structure for the specific branch or course.Moreover, we were told not to ride on two different boats means we should not fill two scholarships ,its wrong, only one is enough for an individual.Also for the scholarship amount to be transferred,the students need their own bank account which is really important . If not possible due to any reason , a subsidiary amount can be user which must be of any of the parents (father or mother). Students were told that the documents and the photos which they will upload should be really clear , not blurred . The discussion ended with telling us that if students don't want to avail the scholarship instead if they want to donate money ,then they can also do so.

## Food - a pivotal role in student's overall wellness
This lecture was given by Dr Arshdeep singh who is currently working in Punjab agricultural university as a food specialist.

In the lecture , the speakers introduced to us that the food we eat everyday has a very deep effect on our overall body working and mental health. Food is really important which should include a balanced diet containing good carbs ,proteins and fats.

Also he told us that we should on rely on the fast food and the processed food to fill our appetite instead it should be the minor part of out diet and the major part of our diet should include healthy homemade food. He further told us that we can take `jaggery`, `lassi`, `curd`and `yogurt` in our diet which will be really helpful. Several common myths were addressed, such as the belief that milk should not be consumed with meals as it leads to a skin disease which is totally wrong and illogical to say or that drinking tea with cold foods is harmful .

We were also advised against consuming cold drinks due to their high sugar content , we were told thag the soft drinks contain upto 70 percent of just sugar . As a healthier alternative, it was suggested to drink Maaza mixed with soda water to reduce sugar intake while still enjoying a refreshing and fizzy beverage as soda only contains carbon dioxide . 

Moreover , he cleared our minds that the fruit drinks that we consume don't contain the real pure fruit juice but an alternative derived chemical that is the food concentrate etc .Further we are awared about the white sugar and the brown sugar ,the difference is just that white sugar is processed . Furthermore we were told about the white bread , brown bread and whole wheat grain bread , their differences also. 

It ended up by the fact that we should really note that what we eat and is it good for our health (mental + physical) .


## Github repo creation and markdown syntax

We were given a tutorial about the github (signing up )and how to create a repository specifically a readme file and told about the markdown language and its basic syntax . It was really interesting to know such a new place to write the data and whole day experiences. The whole lecture was given by senior Harsimran singh in the college auditorium .

### Then mam Harpreet kaur grewal (HOD - Applied sciences) did some announcements about regularly attending classes , changing sections and downloading bonafide and fee structure from the college website .
